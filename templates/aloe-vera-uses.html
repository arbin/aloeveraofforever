					<p class="small">Aloe Vera and Benefits of its Inner Gel&#8217;s Antioxidant Properties<br>

	
Why I recommend daily use of Aloe Vera and benefits available to you and your family through its powerful antioxidant properties<br>

The Aloe Vera gel has powerful antioxidant properties. When consumed daily the antioxidant properties of the Aloe Vera gel can have a huge impact on the effects of aging in an individual as well as on a person&#8217;s overall well-being.<br>

Many of today&#8217;s most common diseases have been associated with a deficiency of antioxidants and the action of &#8216;free radicals&#8217;.<br>

Did you know that your antioxidant level is capable of determining your biological age and your expected lifespan? That&#8217;s how important your antioxidant level is!<br>

Did you also know that you&#8217;ve just breathed in one million free radicals? And another million and another million&#8230;?<br>

Amazing but true!<br>

Each time you inhale, one million free radicals are introduced into your system.<br>

Note: A Free Radical is simply a substance that has an uneven number of electrons.<br>

The most important structural feature of an atom for determining its chemical behavior is the number of electrons it has orbiting around it.<br>

Substances that have an even number of electrons tend not to react chemically.<br>

However a free radical because of the uneven number of electrons it contains, will frantically attempt to gain the electron it needs to bring it back to even stability.<br>

Generally, free radicals attack the nearest stable molecule, &#8217;stealing&#8217; its electron. When the &#8216;attacked&#8217; molecule loses its electron it in turn becomes a free radical, beginning a chain reaction.<br>

Once the process is started, it can have a domino effect, ultimately resulting in damage to important cellular components such as DNA or the cell membrane. Cells may function poorly or die if this occurs.<br>

Free radical damage comes from exposure to pollution, toxins, sunlight, smoking, fried foods, exhaust fumes, stress as well as by natural biological and body processes.<br>

Antioxidants on the other hand are molecules which can safely interact with free radicals and, by &#8216;donating&#8217; one of their own electrons, terminate the chain reaction initiated by free radicals before vital molecules are damaged.<br>

The human body has a defense system of antioxidants to prevent or minimize free radical damage but if antioxidants are unavailable, or if the production of free radicals exceeds the capability of available antioxidants, damage can occur. This danger increases with age.<br>


Aloe Vera gel is unquestionably one of the most powerful and naturally occurring antioxidants available today.<br>

It contains a cocktail of antioxidant vitamins that disarm these harmful free radicals and assist you in achieving optimum health.<br>

Vitamins Vitamin A (Beta-Carotene), B, C and E &#8211; which are just a few of the components of Aloe Vera &#8211; are examples of these antioxidant vitamins.<br>

Antioxidants supplied by the human body include Glutathione, Alpha-lipoic acid and coenzyme Q10.<br>

Over time the balance between your intake of antioxidants and free radicals could easily mean the difference between a long, healthy life and early, premature death.<br>

A few lifestyle adjustments can significantly improve your health, take the 75-Second AloeVeraBenefits.com health quiz to learn how Aloe Vera and benefits of its powerful antioxidant properties can start to work for you and your family.<br>

You can also read compelling research findings that confirm the power of Aloe Vera and benefits of its inner gel in treating cancer and a host of other ailments and diseases.</p>

					<h2 class="heading"><span class="left"><strong>TOP 10 REASONS TO DRINK ALOE VERA GEL</strong></span></h2>
					<p class="small">
<strong>10. Dental Health and Hygiene</strong>

Aloe Vera is extremely healthful for your mouth and gums. Take that to your next dentist appointment!

<strong>9.Provides Rapid Soothing</strong>
Aloe Vera enhances fibroblast function. Fibroblast are those remarkable little cells responsible for collagen formation. They also assist in the soothing of minor burns, cuts, scrapes and skin irritations. 

<strong>8.Aids in Healthy Digestion</strong>
A healthy digestive tract ensures that nutrients from the foods we eat are absorbed into the blood stream. Aloe Vera has natural, detoxifying abilities. Drinking Aloe Vera Gel regularly may improve bowel regularity and increase protein absorption, while at the same time decrease unfriendly bacteria and yeast ?all done naturally! Aloe Vera has also demonstrated its ability to assist in soothing heartburn and other types of digestive upset. 

<strong>7.Immune Support and Function</strong> 
Aloe Vera provides natural support for the immune system. Since the immune system works around the clock protecting the body, aloe vera, with its natural immune enhancers, gives the body a continual arsenal from which to draw. Drinking 2 to 4 ounces of Aloe Vera Gel regularly may give your immune system the helping hand it needs

<strong>6.Regulates Weight and Energy Levels</strong> 
Aloe Vera Gel naturally, and with regular use, allows the body to cleanse the digestive system. Our diets include many unwanted substances which can cause lethargy and exhaustion. Taken regularly, Aloe Vera Gel ensures a greater feeling of well-being, allowing energy levels to increase and helping to maintain a healthy body weight.

<strong>5.Collagen and Elastin Repair</strong> 
Aloe Vera can add a rich supply of building materials to produce and maintain healthy skin. The skin replenishes itself every 21 to 28 days. Using the nutritional building blocks of aloe vera, the skin can utilize these nutrients daily to help combat the effects of aging! A daily dose of Aloe Vera Gel can be just what your skin is thirsting for. 

<strong>4.Daily Dose of Minerals</strong>
Some of the minerals found in aloe vera include calcium, sodium, iron, potassium, chromium, magnesium, manganese, copper, and zinc. What a powerful storehouse! We all know that adding foods to our diets with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals is recommended for overall health. Drinking Aloe Vera Gel is a natural and healthful way to replenish the body supply. 

<strong>3.Daily Dose of Vitamins</strong> 
Aloe Vera Gel includes Vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C and E, Folic Acid and Niacin. The human body simply cannot store some of these vitamins; therefore we need to supplement them regularly through our diets. What better way than by drinking a daily dose of Aloe Vera Gel, while at the same time building the body defense system naturally against oxidative stress!

<strong>2. Anti-inflammatory Properties</strong>
Aloe Vera Gel has 12 natural substances that have been shown to inhibit inflammation without side effects. Aloe may also support proper joint and muscle mobility. 

<strong>1. Body-Building Blocks</strong>
Amino acids are our body building blocks. Eight which are essential and cannot be made by the body are found within the aloe plant! Drinking Aloe Vera on a regular basis allows you to help maintain your health by replenishing your body naturally with these essential amino acids. An analysis of the aloe vera plant shows that it comes closer than any other known plant to the duplication of essential amino acids. Just think ? all this, and in just 2 to 4 ounces a day.

					<p class="medium">Why should I buy Forever Living Aloe when I can buy other brands cheaper?</p>
<p class="medium">It is a valid question and perhaps we can better answer you with the following information:</p>
					<p class="small">
<ul>
<li> We are the world's largest grower and distributor of Aloe Vera.  We own plantations in the USA and the Caribbean both prime growing climates.  Therefore we can tell you EXACTLY how and where our aloe was grown.  For example, we know and can assure you that no pesticides or herbicides are used in our Aloe Vera fields.</li>
<li> We control the whole process, from choosing which leaves are ripe for harvest, right through to the storage temperature after bottling.  We are not dependent on any other supplier.</li>
<li> Our gel is extracted from freshly harvested, mature leaves and stabilized to protect its essential nutritional content within hours.  The stabilization process is patented by Forever Living Products President Rex Maughan.</li>
<li> No artificial flavoring or colouring is added to our gel.  As there are many harvests during the course of the year, colour and taste may vary.  It has been known for some companies to add bleaching agents to their Aloe Vera products, to keep the colour consistent on the shelves, all year long.  We firmly believe that the colour is NATURAL and HEALTHY.</li>
<li> Although a large proportion of Aloe Vera gel is naturally composed of water, anybody seeing the raw gel will know that is not a thin clear liquid.  Our Aloe Vera Gel is NOT homogenized or filtered.  Our drinks have a rich pulp which settles and contains much of the goodness of Aloe Vera that is necessary in our daily diets. We advise you to shack the drinks well to receive the full benefit from our pulp.  There are some companies who offer Aloe Vera with the pulp strained, giving it the appearance of bottle water, in recent times, whole-leaf aloe vera has attracted much attention and is presented by its manufacturers as providing extra benefits.  They often avoid mentioning that in order to remove the strong laxative elements found in outer leaf, they must pass the whole liquid through charcoal filters, which inevitably upsets the natural balance of nutrients found in the gel.  FLP does not have to risk the integrity of the product by subjecting the gel to this filtering process.  Since the traditional, well-proven benefits of aloe vera are found in the gel, not the rind, FLP discards the useless rinds, using them as natural fertilizers in its aloe fields!</li>
<li> Our Aloe Vera is not boiled. Boiling or pasteurization is cheaper and faster.  Excessive heat destroys the active ingredients.  We use only sub-pasteurization temperatures (known as cool processing) to ensure enzyme activity is preserved.  Cool processing locks in nutrients immediately after harvesting and enables the product to retain its full potency for a greater time.</li>
<li> Our Aloe Vera is not reconstituted from freeze-dried gel.  This is how some companies can offer double-strength products and so on.  Our products contain 100% stabilized Aloe Vera gel, from plant to product to you.</li>
<li> 100 % stabilized Aloe Vera is the FIRST ingredient on the labels of our drinks, gelly and lotions.</li>
<li> The Food and Drug Laboratories of New York have declared that our Aloe Vera Gel is essentially identical to the raw gel.  In other words, drinking our Aloe Vera Gel is like breaking open a leaf and scooping out the gel.</li>
<li> There us a complete retail money-back guarantee on all our products, which is not offered on most store-bought Aloe Vera.</li>
</ul>
